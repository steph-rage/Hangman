# Hangman

A Python program using Bokeh visualizer to play an interactive game of hangman.  

## Getting Started

This program uses Python and Bokeh. Download the files and run 

		pip install -r requirements.txt

to make sure you have the necessary programs. 

## Running

Run the program using

		python Hangman.py

It will auto-generate a plot with an empty hangman game, and the blanks for the word you are to guess. In order to guess, you have to type on the command line, then wait for the plot to load again with your guess in place. It's a little bit slow, but it's fun!
